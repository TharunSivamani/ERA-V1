# Task

1. Rewrite the whole code covered in the class in Pytorch-Lightning (code copy will not be provided)
2. Train the model for 10 epochs
3. Achieve a loss of less than 4

<br>

# Objective

* The objective of this assignment:

1. Understand the internal structure of transformers, so you can modify at your will
2. Loss should start from 9-10, and reduce to 4, showing that your code is working
