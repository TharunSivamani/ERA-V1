# Task

1. Move your S10 assignment to Lightning first and then to Spaces such that:
- (You have retrained your model on Lightning)
- You are using Gradio
- Your spaces app has these features:
    - ask the user whether he/she wants to see GradCAM images and how many, and from which layer, allow opacity change as well
    - ask whether he/she wants to view misclassified images, and how many
    - allow users to upload new images, as well as provide 10 example images
    - ask how many top classes are to be shown (make sure the user cannot enter more than 10)
- Add the full details on what your App is doing to Spaces README
