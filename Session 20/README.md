# ERA - V1
## Session 20 - Generative Art and Stable Diffusion

# Task

Read the textual inversion section on [this](https://github.com/fastai/diffusion-nbs/blob/master/Stable%20Diffusion%20Deep%20Dive.ipynb) to an external site. page. There's a mention of a **community-created SD concepts library** and a download of the learned_embeds.bin file. There is also a mention of "blue_loss" in the Guidance Section.

- select 5 different styles of your choice and show output for the same prompt using these 5 different styles. Remember the seeds as you'll use them later. Keep seeds different for each 5 types.
- now apply your own variant of "blue_loss" (it cannot be red, green, or blue loss) on the same prompts with each concept library and store the results.

# Solution

This repository contains a notebook that demonstrates Stable Diffusion and various concepts like Textual Inversion and some extra control to the generation process.
